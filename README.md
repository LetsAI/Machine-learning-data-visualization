# Machine learning dynamic data visualization
 This is an example of how to visualize the data while the training process is happening like the loss, accuracy, number of epochs and other parameters using:
* [**CanvasJS**](https://canvasjs.com/)
* [**ML5**](https://ml5js.org/)<br/>

Because I didn't find many documentations on how to visualize a dynamic data on the internet, this example is to share an idea of how to simplify data visualization easily with fewer lines of code.
