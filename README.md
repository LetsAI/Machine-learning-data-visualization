 This is an example of how to visualize the data while the training process is happening like the loss, accuracy, number of epochs and other parameters using:
* [**CanvasJS**](https://canvasjs.com/)
* [**ML5**](https://ml5js.org/)<br/>

Because I didn't find many documentations on how to visualize a dynamic data on the internet, this example is to share an idea of how to simplify data visualization easily with fewer lines of code.
